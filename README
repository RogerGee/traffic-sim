traffic sim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a simple traffic simulator with a GUI. The GUI interopts with
OpenGL to produce graphics. Currently the project supports Microsoft Windows and
any platform running an X Server with Gtk.

Building

[MS Windows] We recommend using either the MinGW compiler or the Microsoft
Visual C++ compiler. Disclaimer: we have not tested with MSVC++. Some C++11
features may not be fully implemented by that compiler (unfortunately). To build
using MinGW, run the build.bat. To build a debug version, which is a console
application, run 'build debug'. If you have Make installed, run 'build make' to
run the Windows-specific makefile. Note: the 'makefile' targets Gtk/X but
'makefile-win32' targets Win32. Optionally you can build the resources file with
'build res' so that visual styles and icons are enabled.

[Gtk/X] Hopefully your distro has GCC (with g++) installed along with
GNUMake. To build simply run 'make' from the command-line. You must have Gtk-3.0
development files that are configurable with pkg-config. Also you need to have
XLib development files since we interopt with the XServer using Gdk.

Using the simulator

The simulator consists of a single 4-lane intersection. Vehicles are represented
as blocks that move along the lanes. The control panel lets you control the
simulation as well as see different metrics gathered from the simulation. Once
you start the simulator, you can pause it with the pause button or reset it by
clicking 'Stop'. Three scale bars control different parameters to the
simulation. Their effects take place in real-time.
