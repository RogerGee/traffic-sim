Description

Design a system for simulating traffic at an intersection. It will hopefully
look better than this:

                   LLLL   | C    |

Basic requirements

1. Cars move at constant speed of 1/2 car length when the light is green.

2. Yellow light: stop if not in intersection yet; continue through intersection
if already in it

3. Once past intersection, lights aren't applicable.

4. Car needs 6 time cycles to clear intersection.

5. Space for exactly 10 cars before intersection

    - The road can be implemented as a series of discrete steps of 1/2 car
length.

    - Cars don't require any empty space between them.

    - Yellow lights should last for 6 time steps (for safety)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Input

    - length of red/green lights may be adjusted (not yellow light)
    - rate of addition of new cars into simulation
    - length of time to run simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output

    - average wait time per car
    - lowest wait time
    - longest wait time
    - average number of waiting cars per time step
